# 📈 Python Stock Analysis Project

A Python-based analytics project for computing and visualizing commonly used **technical indicators** on real-world stock market data.  
The project emphasizes **clarity, correctness, and algorithmic soundness** over unnecessary complexity.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Fetches historical stock price data using **yfinance**
- Computes key technical indicators:
  - **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**
  - **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**
  - **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**
  - **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**
- Visualizes indicators using **matplotlib**
- Modular, readable codebase designed for easy extension

---

## 🧠 Motivation

This project was built to:
- Strengthen understanding of **time-series analysis**
- Apply algorithmic thinking to real financial data
- Focus on **practical signal interpretation**, not over-engineered solutions
- Serve as a foundation for future extensions such as:
  - strategy backtesting
  - machine learning integration
  - performance optimization
